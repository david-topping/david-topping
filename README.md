## Outside of work

### 🥫 Food Facts Friends: Food Bank Website
This is my main side project at the moment.

I’m developing and maintaining the website for **Food Facts Friends**, a local food bank charity.

🔗 https://foodfactsfriends.org.uk

It’s a deliberately practical project, no over-engineering, just building something useful for real people.

If you’re interested in working together on a **side project, charity website, or small product**, feel free to get in touch.
